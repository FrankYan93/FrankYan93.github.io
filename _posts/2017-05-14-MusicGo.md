## Getting Started
0. install homebrew
1. `brew tap homebrew/science`
2. `brew install hdf5`
3. `pip install Cython`
4. install Tables by `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/PyTables/PyTables`
5. install other packages mentioned in **Dependency**.
6. build elasticsearch as mentioned in **Build Elasticsearch**
7. type `redis-server` in terminal
8. open another  terminal window, type:
```
cd elasticsearch-<version>
./bin/elasticsearch
```
9. `python query.py`


## Build Elasticsearch
- `cp lib/name_syn.txt [your elasticsearch path]/config/name_syn.txt`
- `cp lib/cat_syn.txt [your elasticsearch path]/config/cat_syn.txt`   
(It is not recommended, but if you really want to let your web application access a folder outside its deployment directory. You need to add permission in java.policy file. Details see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10454037/java-security-accesscontrolexception-access-denied-java-io-filepermission)
- open elasticsearch server:
  `cd elasticsearch-<version>  
  ./bin/elasticsearch`  
- run `python ./lib/buildElaticSearch.py`
- build time: 9s
- use another terminal to run `redis-server`

{"1":{  
    "trackID": string,  
    "title": (song's name) string,  
    "year": int,  
    "song_hotttnesss": float,

  ...  
}

## Test Set and sample queries
We have a test corpus `sample_corpus.json`. To build elasticsearch with this corpus, call build method with the path of sample corpus as parameter: `build("sample_corpus.json")`

#### search by query
1. simple query: {'description': u'love'}}
2. advanced search query:
d_query = {'title': u'',
              'lyric': u'',
              'album': u'',
              'max_longitude': u'', 'min_longitude': u'',
              'description': u'love',
              'max_duration': u'','min_duration': u'',
              'artist_name': u'',
              'min_latitude': u'', 'max_latitude': u'',
              'year': u'',
              'genre': u'',
              'artist_location': u''}

#### search by track
The parameter is the track_id

#### sort
use 'hot' or 'dance' as parameter, the results will sort by song_hotttnesss or danceability.

#### How to search
search({'description': u'love'},'hot')
search(d_query,'hot')
search_track(1,'dance')
